Our mission is to help college students create significant learning experiences in their college courses. (L. Dee Fink) 
We will do so by leveraging learning science and productivity management systems so that students can engage in their courses with less barriers to entry.
A goal of this is to position students so that by the end of their course, they have a portfolio of work that they can leverage in the near and far future. We trust that this is the future of networking; to bring transparency about what / why / how we learn.
